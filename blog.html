               <b><i><u>Data science</u></i></b> is an <b>inter-disciplinary </b> field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.[1][2] Data science is related to data mining, deep learning and big data.
               Data science is a <q>concept to unify statistics</q>, data analysis, machine learning, domain knowledge and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge

            <p>
               In 1962,<b>John Tukey</b>  described a field he called <q>data analysis</q>, which resembles modern data science.[17] Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.[18][19]
               The term <q>data science</q> has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science.[20] In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.[20] However, the definition was still in flux. In 1997, C.F. Jeff Wu suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data.[21] In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.[22]
               During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included �knowledge discovery� and �data mining

               The modern conception of data science as an <i>independent</i> discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland.[24] In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name."Data science" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology launched Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science.[23] In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.[25]
               The professional title of �data scientist� has been attributed to DJ Patil and<u>Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008.</u>  Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report, "Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century," it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.
